- 9/15 version 1.0


1 Which statement best distinguishes programming from software engineering?
1. Programming focuses on application design, while software engineering focuses on coding only
2. _**Programming is writing and designing code in a programming language; software engineering uses engineering principles independent of language**_ 
3. Programming involves unit testing; software engineering defers testing until the application is ready to deploy
